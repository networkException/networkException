### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm (mostly) a backend dev but find myself working with frontend web way too much

#### My stats

![networkException's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=networkException&show_icons=true)

#### Stuff about me

> ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

some smaller side projects using node, typescript and fabricmc

> ğŸŒ± I learned

to better understand Minecraft's code to make better mods ^^

that enums together with functional interfaces are great in Java

that JavaScript arrays are just objects with indicees as keys (huge shoutout to the work on [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity), especially LibJS)

how to properly use gradle (I hope)

> ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with

getting sponge to interupt a constuctor call

> ğŸ’¬ Ask me about

anything you want! I will try my best to help you out, but the most success you will probably have with topics like Minecraft, Discord and Java

> ğŸ“« Reach out to me on

[networkException#0001@discord](http://discord.nwex.de/), [networkexception@keybase](http://keybase.nwex.de/) (you will also find platforms like twitter linked there), [nwex.de](https://nwex.de/) (not much yet) or [github@nwex.de](mailto:github@nwex.de)!
