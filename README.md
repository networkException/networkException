I am a developer, maintainer and system administrator working on a variety of open source projects.

You SHOULD use [she/her](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/she/her/her/hers/herself) or [they/them](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/they/them/their/theirs/themself) and you SHOULD NOT use [he/him](https://pronouns.within.lgbt/he/him/his/his/himself) pronouns when referring to me.

In German, you SHOULD use sie/ihr or <abbr title="Example: Es entwickelt an Open Source Software, ihr GitHub findest du hier.">es/ihr</abbr> and you SHOULD NOT use er/ihm pronouns.

As a third party communicating my preferred pronouns to others in written form, you MUST use "she/they". If the target audience is German you MAY
use "sie/ihr" or "es/ihr". You MIGHT also link back to this document for up to date guidance using the canonical repository link mentioned below.
